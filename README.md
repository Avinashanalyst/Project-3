# Inventory and Demand Forecasting Dashboard for E-commerce

## **Overview**
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for an e-commerce platform to optimize inventory management, reduce stockouts, and enhance decision-making in procurement and warehousing. The dashboard integrates SQL for data extraction, Python for advanced demand forecasting using ARIMA, and Power BI for visualizing inventory metrics and trends.
